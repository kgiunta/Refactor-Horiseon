# Refactor-Horiseon

## Description

As my first attempt for building my professional portfolio I was given a single webpage create. The importance of this page was to provide insight on marketing and the importance of SEO as well as online presence management. This was a helpful activity in order to help my debugging skills as well as build my CSS knowledge. 

## Installation

Initally handed messy code based on client's need. Refactored the website by condensing CSS styles and creating a shorter more efficient source code. 
This was installed via github from local files. 


## Usage

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

   
    ![alt text](.assets/images/screenshot.png)
