# Refactor-Horiseon

## Description

As my first attempt for building my professional portfolio I was given a single webpage create. The importance of this page was to provide insight on marketing and the importance of SEO as well as online presence management. This was a helpful activity in order to help my debugging skills as well as build my CSS knowledge.
