# Refactor-Horiseon

## Description

As my first attempt for building my professional portfolio I was given a single webpage to provide insight on marketing and the importance of SEO and online presence management.  Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?



## Installation

Initally handed messy code based on client's need. Refactored the website by condensing CSS styles and creating a shorter more efficient source code.  
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
